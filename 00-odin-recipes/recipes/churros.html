    <p> A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Churros are similar to doughnuts, 
    but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior 
    with a satisfyingly crispy exterior.</p>
